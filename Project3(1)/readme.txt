Description
- This code will be performing the pass 2 of the assembler. First you perform pass 1 
which was project 2, and then pass 2. When the program performs pass 2, it must check for 
if the sic operation is a directive or an opcode. Form there on, it will get the addresses
and write the object codes into the lst and obj files.

Extra Credit
- No

Experience
- For some reason I had an issue using Virtual Studio where a certain operand was getting
read wrong. But when I compiled it using the windows command prompt, everything was working
properly.
